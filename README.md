# FastAPI API with JWT Authentication & Roles

A robust REST API built with Python and FastAPI. It demonstrates a complete CRUD implementation for managing users, with data persisted in a SQL database and secured by JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **FastAPI**: High-performance, asynchronous web framework.
-   **JWT Authentication**: Secure user login and session management.
-   **Password Hashing**: Uses `bcrypt` to securely store user passwords.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Differentiates between `user` and `admin` roles to protect specific endpoints.
-   **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Powerful database interaction and modeling.
-   **Alembic Migrations**: Manages database schema changes safely.
-   **Pydantic**: Handles data validation and settings management from `.env` files.
-   **Redis Caching**: Caches frequently accessed data to improve performance.
